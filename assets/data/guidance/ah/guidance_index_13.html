Emergency reserves already contribute to sustainability by avoiding poor animal health and welfare associated with livestock losses.  <br>P2. Rapid destocking with appropriate carcasses disposal contributes to sustainability by avoiding polluting water sources and drinking water, threatening the lives of both people and livestock.<br>P2. Make provision of diagnostic sampling material and personal protective equipment. <br>P2. Make provisions to ensure the correct transport of biologicals (vaccines and antibiotics) in terms of time and temperature.<br>P7. Include resources in the contingency fund for assessing and addressing the implications of destocking and restocking initiatives on farmers livelihood</div> </div>
