<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Select for improved genetics within the existing herd.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Improving animal genetics already contributes to sustainability by avoiding the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with less-productive animals and the presence of nonproductive animals in the herd, i.e., the breeding overhead. FAO 2010, IAEA 2007. Consider the effect of this intervention on the resilience of the system to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. <br>P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feed, potentially increasing the environmental impacts of feed production. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably. LEAP 2016b.<br></div> </div>
