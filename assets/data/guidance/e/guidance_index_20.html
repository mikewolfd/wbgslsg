Livestock health and welfare improvements already contribute to sustainability by reducing morbidity and mortality as well as lowering stress on the animal. This, in turn, increases productivity, reduces incentives to increase herd size to compensate for animal losses, and consequently lowers GHG emissions and other environmental impacts. FAO 2011, FAWC 2009.<br>P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on water and land resources. WB 2016.<br>P7. Raise awareness among farmers about the environmental benefits of improving livestock health and welfare.</div> </div>
