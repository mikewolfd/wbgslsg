Grassland productivity already contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities by improving livestock productivity and increasing carbon stocks. It can also have positive effects on water cycles and biodiversity. <br>P2. P7. Provide farmers with technical assistance, financing options, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms on integrated land management planning. Such planning will optimize grazing or feed production as well as the use of locally available agro-industrial by-products and imported feed, contributing to improved grassland, individual livestock, and herd productivity while also enhancing carbon stocks and reducing pressure on land and water resources.<br>P2. P7. When developing integrated grassland management plans, ensure that environmental objectives, such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and water resource replenishment, are included among the objectives of the plans. LEAP 2016a, LEAP 2016e.<br>P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. To moderate this incentive, activities to improve feeding should include incentives to control growth in the overall number of livestock. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on land degradation and pressure on water resources. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f.<br>P2. P7. Provide technical assistance for the preservation and restoration of natural grassland (conserving and restoring natural habitats, increasing biomass per unit area). Assess the resilience of grasslands to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability.</div> </div>
