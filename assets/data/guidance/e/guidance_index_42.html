<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Optimize the beef value chain of calf production, intermediate fattening, and finishing.<br>Undertake territorial planning to identify and develop reproductive regions (drier) and fattening regions (wetter). <br>Develop transportation networks to transport livestock within the meat value chains.<br>Optimize the offtake rate (the proportion of the herd that is sold or consumed each year).<br>Create a market demand for products of fattening activities.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Optimizing the offtake rate in pastoral herds, i.e., removing young males for fattening in higher-productivity areas, already contributes to sustainability by reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with productivity losses.<br>P3, P4, P7. Meat production systems for beef cattle and small ruminants are often organized in separate stages: the production of young fattening animals at breeder farms (where the reproductive herd is kept), final fattening at intensive farms (feedlots), and in some cases an intermediate stage (semi-intensive, referred to as a feeder farm). These various stages in the fattening chain may be integrated or not. Design a configuration of the supply chain which minimizes environmental impacts along the chain while also taking care of other sustainability issues. The size of the reproductive herd, the amount and quality of feed used in each stage, and the duration of each step should be optimized. LEAP 2016b, LEAP 2016f.<br>P2. P7. Provide technical assistance on territorial planning for the development of fattening activities which considers available natural resources. Assess the resilience of grassland regions to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability. LEAP 2016a.<br>P4. P2. Provide technical assistance and financing options for sustainable feed production and/or sourcing to sustain fattening activities, especially with regard to water use efficiency. LEAP 2016b.<br>P5. Provide technical assistance and financing options for managing manure from fattening activities: collection, storage, and appropriate timing and dosing of application. Teenstra et al. 2014, SNV Biogas.<br>P3. Developing fattening activities may incentivize growth in overall livestock numbers. Evaluate the potential implications of increasing livestock numbers on land use change and water resources. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f, LEAP 2016a.<br>P6. Provide technical assistance and financing options for reducing fossil fuel emissions from livestock transport. LEAP 2016f.<br>P3.
