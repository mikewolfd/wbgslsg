Adequate feed ration balancing already contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities by improving the efficiency of the digestive process and the productivity of animals. Feedipedia.<br>P4. P7. Raise awareness among stakeholders and provide technical assistance, financing options, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms for sustainable feed production in mixed crop-livestock systems. Assess local availability of high-quality roughages and of concentrate feed ingredients, as well as potential impacts of improving and/or increasing feed production on water and land resources. FAO 2012a, FAO 2012b, FAO 2014a. Consider the effect of this intervention on GHG emissions and the resilience of the system to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. Adopt feed budgeting approaches and feed conservation to ensure a stable feed supply throughout each season.<br>P4. P7. Source sustainably any imported feed, considering the fossil fuel emissions generated by feed production and transport, as well as the use of heavy metals and other environmental impacts on land and water resources. Include the environmental impacts associated with imported feed in project environmental impact assessments. LEAP 2016b. Explore the feasibility of a livestock feed certification and labeling scheme.<br>P3. Improved feed availability and quality may not only increase animal productivity but also incentivize herd growth. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in animal numbers on water and land resources. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f.</div> </div>
