<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Import animals/animal semen with improved genetics for crossbreeding.<br>Select for improved genetics within the existing herd.<br>Develop artificial insemination.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Improving animal genetics already contributes to sustainability by avoiding the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with less-productive animals and the presence of nonproductive animals in the herd, i.e., the breeding overhead. FAO 2010, IAEA 2007.<br>P3. Consider the effect of this intervention on the resilience of animals and the system as a whole to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. <br>P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feeds, potentially increasing the environmental impacts of feed production. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably. LEAP 2016b.</div> </div>
