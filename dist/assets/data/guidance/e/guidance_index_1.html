Livestock health and welfare improvements already contribute to sustainability by reducing morbidity and mortality as well as stress on the animal. This, in turn, boosts productivity, reduces incentives to increase herd size to compensate for livestock losses, and consequently lowers GHG emissions and other environmental impacts. FAO 2011, FAWC 2009.<br>P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on water and land resource management. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f, LEAP 2016a.<br>P7. Raise awareness among pastoralists on the environmental benefits of improving livestock.</div> </div>
