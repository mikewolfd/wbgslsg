<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Develop strategic feed reserves for use in drought and other climate- and/or weather-related emergencies.<br>Develop strategic reserves of vaccines, antibiotics, and other disease prevention and control material for use in livestock health emergencies.<br>Develop strategic reserves for sampling material and personal protective equipment to implemented ad hoc diagnoses or surveys in case of animal health emergencies <br>Undertake rapid destocking (and restocking) in anticipation of drought or any other emergency.<br>Carry out livestock distribution (restocking) for rapid recovery.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Emergency reserves already contribute to sustainability by avoiding the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with livestock losses.  <br>P2. Rapid destocking already contributes to sustainability by avoiding rangeland and pasture degradation during drought.  <br>P5. In destocking, if livestock is held in confined spaces and/or slaughtered, ensure proper waste management and sustainable use of land and water resources.<br>P7. Include resources in the contingency fund for assessing and addressing the implications of destocking and restocking initiatives on land and water resources.<br></div> </div>
