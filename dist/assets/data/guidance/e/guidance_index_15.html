<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Develop a national livestock master plan.<br>Establish regulations for the zoning of livestock grazing and mobility (transhumance) areas.<br>Improve equity of grazing and water use rights within pastoralist communities. <br>Pilot programs to enable pastoralists to access donor and other multinational financing.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P7. In the context of resource-scarce pastoral environments, improving equity in land and water use contributes to the resilience of smaller-scale and more vulnerable livestock keepers.<br>P7. Ensure that integrated approaches to land and water resource management are embedded in national livestock development planning. Include targets for water management and reduced GHG emissions. Make provision for targeting the areas and type of producers where progress toward environmental sustainability can be established most cost-effectively. Develop timelines for the progressive introduction of environmental policies.<br>P7. Develop programs that generate environmental benefits (e.g., a national payments for environmental services scheme tailored to sustainable rangeland and pasture management, international climate finance for carbon credits, and linking to nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement).<br>P2. P7. When developing integrated grassland (pastures and rangelands) management plans, ensure that environmental objectives, such as carbon sequestration and water resources replenishment, are included among the objectives of the plans. <br>P7. Formalize and protect pastoralist access to corridors, rangelands, and pastures. While potentially conflicting with the principles of communal land management, formalizing pastoralist access to grazing areas will enable a more complete use of available feed resources in a resource-scarce pastoral environment.</div> </div>
