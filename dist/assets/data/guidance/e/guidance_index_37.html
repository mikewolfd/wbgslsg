<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Select for improved genetics within the existing herd.<br>Develop breeding programs with exotic and local genetic resources.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Improving livestock genetics already contributes to sustainability by avoiding GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with less-productive animals.<br>P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feed, potentially increasing the environmental impacts of feed production. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably. LEAP 2016b.<br>P3. Promote improvements to breeding and livestock genetics that allow for reducing the number of animals in the reproductive herd, avoiding the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with such animals. FAO 2010, IAEA 2007. Consider the effect of this intervention on the resilience of the system to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. </div> </div>
