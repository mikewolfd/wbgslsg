Ensure that approaches to land and water resource management are embedded in national livestock development planning. Include targets for biodiversity, water management, and GHG emission reduction. Make provision for targeting the areas and type of producers where progress toward environmental sustainability can be established most cost-effectively. Develop timelines for the progressive introduction of environmental policies.<br>P7. Develop programs that generate environmental benefits (e.g. a national payments for environmental services scheme tailored to sustainable rangeland and pasture management, international climate finance for carbon credits, revision of public subsidy schemes, and linking to nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement).<br>P2. P7. When developing integrated grassland (pastures and rangelands) management plans, ensure that environmental objectives, such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and water resources replenishment, are included among the objectives of the plans. </div> </div>
