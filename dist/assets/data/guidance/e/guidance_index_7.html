<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Undertake territorial planning to identify and develop reproductive regions (drier) and fattening regions (wetter). <br>Develop transportation networks to transport livestock to and from fattening areas.<br>Optimize the offtake rate (the proportion of the herd that is sold or consumed each year).<br>Create a market demand for products of fattening activities.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Optimizing the offtake rate in pastoral herds, i.e., removing young males for fattening in higher-productivity areas, already contributes to sustainability by reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with large pastoral herds.<br>P2. P7. Provide technical assistance for territorial planning for the development of fattening activities. Assess the resilience of proposed underutilized areas to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability. LEAP 2016a.<br>P4. P2. Provide technical assistance and financing options for sustainable feed production and/or sourcing to sustain fattening areas, especially with regard to water withdrawals and water use efficiency. LEAP 2016b<br>P5. Provide technical assistance and financing options for managing manure from fattening activities: collection, storage, and appropriate timing and dosing of application. Teenstra et al. 2014, SNV Biogas.<br>P3. Developing fattening activities may incentivize growth in overall livestock numbers. Evaluate the potential implications of increasing livestock numbers on water and land resources. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f, LEAP 2016a.<br>P6. Provide technical assistance and financing options to reduce fossil fuel consumption in livestock transport. LEAP 2016f.<br>P3. Develop guidelines for livestock health and welfare during transport.
