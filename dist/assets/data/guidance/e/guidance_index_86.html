<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Undertake vaccination campaigns and improve disease prevention and control. <br>Avoid spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).<br>Improve animal welfare.<br>Improve biosecurity.<br></div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P3. Animal welfare improvements already contribute to sustainability by reducing stress on the animal (animal welfare). This, in turn, avoids the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with losses in feed conversion ratios. <br>P3. P7. Provide technical assistance and raise awareness among stakeholders about the consequences of using antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal production. Develop regulatory controls to phase out antimicrobials as growth promoters, as well as monitoring systems for the sale and use of antimicrobials in animal production, including the monitoring of residues in animal products. Avoiding the emergence and spread of AMR also improves the resilience of animal production systems to pathogens.<br>P3. P7. Provide technical assistance and raise awareness among stakeholders about the benefits of improving animal health and welfare. Develop guidelines for good animal welfare in industrial systems, where housing conditions and crowding are often challenges. FAWC 2009.</div> </div>
