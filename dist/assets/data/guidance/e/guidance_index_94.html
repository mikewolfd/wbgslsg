<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>  <h3>Activities commonly implemented under this intervention</h3>Improve manure management on farms.<br>Develop territorial approaches to improving the nutrient balance.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>  <h3>Guidance for increased environmental sustainability</h3>P5. P6. P7. Raise awareness among stakeholders about integrated manure management and its co-benefits for the fertility and resilience of agricultural soils. Develop a regulatory framework and provide technical assistance to ensure that manure is adequately managed: collected, safely stored (concrete floor and roof), and processed (e.g., composted, used in anaerobic digestion, dried, and converted into organic fertilizer), or applied to cropland. Ensure that the timing and dosing are in line with nutrient management plans. Teenstra et al. 2014.<br>P5. P7. Support the development of land/livestock balance regulation and national nutrient management plans to utilize the nutrient value of manure in crop production, contributing to soil health, agricultural resilience, and national food security. <br>P5. P7. Develop regulations to incentivize the substitution of synthetic fertilizers with manure (e.g., reduced subsidies on synthetic fertilizers, subsidies for manure storage and processing). LEAP 2018a.<br>P6. P7. Provide livestock farms with technical assistance and financing options for the piloting of biogas schemes to generate renewable energy. SNV Biogas.</div> </div>
