Develop strategic reserves of vaccines, antibiotics, and other disease prevention and control material for use in livestock health emergencies.

Develop strategic reserves for sampling material and personal protective equipment to implemented ad hoc diagnoses or surveys in case of animal health emergencies 

Undertake rapid destocking (and restocking) in anticipation of drought or any other emergency.

Carry out livestock distribution (restocking) for rapid recovery.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Emergency reserves already contribute to sustainability by avoiding the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with livestock losses.  

P2. Rapid destocking already contributes to sustainability by avoiding rangeland and pasture degradation during drought.  

P5. In destocking, if livestock is held in confined spaces and/or slaughtered, ensure proper waste management and sustainable use of land and water resources.

P7. Include resources in the contingency fund for assessing and addressing the implications of destocking and restocking initiatives on land and water resources.
