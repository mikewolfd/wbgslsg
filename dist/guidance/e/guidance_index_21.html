Develop breeding programs with exotic and local genetic resources.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Improving livestock genetics already contributes to sustainability by avoiding GHG emissions and pressure on natural resources associated with less-productive animals (reproductive herd as well as fattening/milking animals). FAO 2010, IAEA 2007.

P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feed, production of which may increase environmental impacts. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably. LEAP 2016b.

P3. Consider the effect of breed improvement and the reduction of herd size on the resilience of the system to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. </div> </div>
