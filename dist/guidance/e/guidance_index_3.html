<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>Develop integrated land management approaches to restore and maintain rangeland and pasture productivity.

Promote adaptive grazing based on small land units in ranches.

Build capacity in natural resource management planning at community and local levels.

Develop water resources and distribution in underexploited rangelands.

Establish dedicated migration corridors (short- and long-distance), rest areas along corridors, pasture reserves, and dedicated dry season grazing areas.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Improving rangeland and pasture productivity already contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities by boosting livestock productivity and augmenting carbon stocks in soil and biomass. 

P2. P7. Provide pastoralists with technical assistance, financing options, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms on integrated land management planning. Such planning will optimize grazing on marginal lands; grazing or feed production in higher productivity areas; and imported feed, thus contributing to rangeland and pasture productivity while also enhancing carbon stocks and reducing pressure on land and water resources. WB 2016.

P2. P7. When developing integrated grassland (pastures and rangelands) management plans, ensure that environmental objectives, such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and water resources replenishment, are included among the objectives of the plans. LEAP 2016a, LEAP 2016e, FAO, 2009, International Land Coalition.

P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on water and land resources. To moderate this incentive, activities to improve feeding should include incentives to control growth in the overall number of animals. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f.

P2. P7. Raise awareness and provide technical assistance on mainstreaming carbon sequestration objectives in natural resource management planning at the communal and/or local level.

P2. P7. Provide technical assistance for enhancing carbon stocks in underexploited rangelands (conserving and restoring natural habitats, increasing biomass per unit area). Assess the resilience of proposed underutilized areas to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability.

P2. Assess the impacts of concentrated livestock populations on carbon stocks and land and water resources (e.g., in corridors, rest areas, and dry season grazing areas) and manage livestock numbers accordingly. Conserve and restore natural habitats and increase biomass per unit area where possible. 

P4. Develop sustainable feed production and/or sourcing for rest areas. Assess the resilience of migration corridors, rest areas, pasture reserves, and dry season grazing areas to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability.</div> </div>
