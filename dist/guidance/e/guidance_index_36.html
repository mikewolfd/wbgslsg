Improve disease prevention and control.

Avoid spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Improve livestock welfare.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Livestock health and welfare improvements already contribute to sustainability by reducing morbidity and mortality as well as stress on the animal. This, in turn, increases productivity, may diminish incentives to increase herd size to compensate for low productivity, and consequently can lower GHG emissions and other environmental impacts. FAO 2011, FAWC 2009.

P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on land use change and water management. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f.

P7. Raise awareness among farmers about the environmental benefits of improving livestock health and welfare.</div> </div>
