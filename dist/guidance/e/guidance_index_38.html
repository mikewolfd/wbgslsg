Develop integrated land management approaches to restore and maintain rangeland and pasture productivity.

Build capacity in natural resource management planning at community and local levels.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Grassland productivity already contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities by improving livestock productivity.

P2. P3. P7. Provide farmers with technical assistance, financing options, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms to develop silvopastoral systems. The combination of pasture, fodder production, and trees in such systems contributes to carbon capture, soil and biodiversity recovery, and the provision of high-quality feeds to livestock, improving productivity. IDB 2016.

P2. P7. When developing integrated grassland management plans, ensure that environmental objectives, such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and water resources replenishment, are included among the objectives of the plans. LEAP 2016a, LEAP 2016e.

P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. To moderate this incentive, activities to improve feeding should include incentives to control growth in the overall number of livestock and related pasture expansion. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on water resources and land use change. LEAP 2018a.

P2. P7. Raise awareness and provide technical assistance to ensure that environmental objectives, such as enhancing carbon stocks and preserving biodiversity, are included in natural resource management planning.

P2. P7. Provide technical assistance for reducing degradation and enhancing carbon stocks in natural grassland areas (conserving and restoring natural habitats, increasing biomass per unit area). Assess the resilience of grasslands to climate change impacts and weather/seasonal variability. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2016f, LEAP 2016e.</div> </div>
