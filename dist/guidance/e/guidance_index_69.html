Source (ingredients for) concentrate feed.

Improve feed ration balancing.
</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Adequate feed ration balancing, for instance, through the application of ration formulation models, improves feed conversion ratio, thus reducing costs per unit produced, improving natural resource use efficiency, and decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of product. Feedipedia.

P4. P5. P7. Raise awareness among stakeholders and provide producers with technical assistance, financing options, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms on sustainable feed production, i.e., production of soybeans and feed maize as a cash crop. Improve crop production practices (for such feed crops but also for rice, fruits, vegetables, and cash crops) with maximal use of manure and/or fish pond sediment. 

P4. P5. P7. Assess local availability of concentrate feed ingredients, i.e., agro-industrial by-products of high nutritional value. Adopt feed budgeting approaches and feed conservation to ensure a stable feed supply throughout each season. Consider the effect of feed interventions on GHG emissions and on water and land resources. Assess the resilience of the system to deal with short- and long-term perturbations, such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. FAO 2012a, FAO 2012b, FAO 2014a.  

P4. P7. Source sustainably any feed imported, considering the fossil fuel emissions generated for feed production and transport, as well as the use of heavy metals and other environmental impacts on land and water resources. Include the environmental impacts associated with imported feed in project environmental impact assessments. LEAP 2016b. Promote the piloting of a livestock feed certification and labeling schemes.

P3. Improved feed availability and quality may not only increase animal productivity but also enable overall production increase. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on GHG emissions, pollution, and land and water use. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2018b, LEAP 2016c.</div> </div>
