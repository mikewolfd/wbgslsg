Improve disease prevention and control.

Avoid antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Improve animal welfare.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Animal health and welfare improvements contribute to sustainability on an animal level by lowering morbidity and mortality, reducing stress on the animal, and consequently improving productivity at the animal and herd levels, since improved health and welfare improve reproductive performance; consequently, smaller populations of reproductive animals can be maintained. Reduced mortality also diminishes incentives to increase livestock population size to compensate for animal losses. Increased productivity and reduced livestock populations subsequently contribute to minimizing pressure on natural resources and emissions per unit of product. 

P7. Raise awareness among stakeholders about the environmental benefits of improving animal health and welfare.

P3. Animal health and welfare improvements may incentivize the growth of the population of pigs, poultry, and ducks, and thus the overall demand for feed and manure produced. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on manure management, GHG emissions, and pressure on land and water resources.
