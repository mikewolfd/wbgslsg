Grazing land area where sustainable land management practices have been adopted as a result of the project — Hectare (ha).</b><div class="description"><p>This indicator measures the adoption of sustainable grassland (rangeland and pasture) management in project intervention areas. The adoption of sustainable land management practices aims to ensure that grazing pressure is in line with productivity and resilience of pasture and rangelands, and with the generation of other ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity, replenishment of aquifers). Positive lists of sustainable land management practices vary according to rangeland biology, climate, and livestock species and may be provided in project documents. They may include land use regimes, agronomic and vegetative measures, and structural measures. Teams may consider using <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6492e.pdf">LEAP 2016 guidelines for assessing the impacts of livestock on biodiversity</a>. à Quantification may rely on a field-based survey based on semi-structured interviews with producers, ranchers, pastoralists, and agro-pastoralists on the change in behavior related to the use of their grassland in targeted zones of the project.</p></div><b>11. Farmers/extension agents/service providers trained on environmental issues and options in the livestock sector — Number.</b><div class="description"><p>This indicator measures the number of stakeholders along the supply chains that have been made aware of and trained on environmental issues in the livestock sector, for instance, through the inclusion of environmental issues and options in curriculums, extension manuals, capacity development programs, etc. à Quantification may be undertaken annually or at the start of the project, at medium term, and during terminal evaluation, using dedicated surveys.</p></div><b>13.
