Optimizing the offtake rate in pastoral herds, i.e., removing young males for fattening in higher-productivity areas, already contributes to sustainability by reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with productivity losses.<br>P3, P4, P7. Meat production systems for beef cattle and small ruminants are often organized in separate stages: the production of young fattening animals at breeder farms (where the reproductive herd is kept), final fattening at intensive farms (feedlots), and in some cases an intermediate stage (semi-intensive, referred to as a feeder farm). These various stages in the fattening chain may be integrated or not. Design a configuration of the supply chain which minimizes environmental impacts along the chain while also taking care of other sustainability issues. The size of the reproductive herd, the amount and quality of feed used in each stage, and the duration of each step should be optimized. LEAP 2016b, LEAP 2016f.<br>P2. P7.
