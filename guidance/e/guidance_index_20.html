Improve livestock welfare.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Livestock health and welfare improvements already contribute to sustainability by reducing morbidity and mortality as well as lowering stress on the animal.

FAO 2011, FAWC 2009.

P3. Livestock productivity improvements may incentivize herd growth and increase overall demand for feed. Evaluate the potential implications of any foreseen increase in livestock numbers on water and land resources. WB 2016.

P7. Raise awareness among farmers about the environmental benefits of improving livestock health and welfare.</div> </div>
