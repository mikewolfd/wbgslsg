<div class='text-area'> <div class='activities-area'>Undertake territorial planning to identify and develop reproductive regions (drier) and fattening regions (wetter). 

Develop transportation networks to transport livestock to and from fattening areas.

Optimize the offtake rate (the proportion of the herd that is sold or consumed each year).

Create a market demand for products of fattening activities.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Optimizing the offtake rate in pastoral herds, i.e., removing young males for fattening in higher-productivity areas, already contributes to sustainability by reducing GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with large pastoral herds.
