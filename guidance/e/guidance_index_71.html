Develop breeding programs with exotic and local genetic resources.
</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Improving livestock genetics boosts productivity and concomitantly contributes to sustainability by reducing GHG emissions and pressure on natural resources per unit of product.

P3. Consider the effect of introducing high-productivity breeds (which require high-quality feed and may not be resilient to diseases) on the broader system resilience to short and long-term perturbations such as droughts, floods, warfare, and climate change. 

P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feeds, potentially increasing the environmental impacts of feed production. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably.</div> </div>
