Develop territorial approaches to improving the nutrient balance.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P5. P6. P7. Raise awareness among stakeholders about integrated manure management and its co-benefits for the fertility and resilience of agricultural soils. Provide technical assistance and financing options to ensure that manure is adequately managed: collected, safely stored (concrete floor and roof), and processed (e.g., composted, used in anaerobic digestion, dried, and processed into organic fertilizer), or applied to fish ponds, cropland, and pastureland. If the latter, ensure that the timing and dosing are in line with requirements. Teenstra et al. 2014.

P5. P7. Support the development of land/livestock balance regulation and national nutrient management plans to utilize the nutrient value of manure and/or fish pond sediment in crop production, contributing to soil health, agricultural resilience, and national food security. Develop or revise policies to incentivize the substitution of synthetic fertilizers with manure and/or fish pond sediment (e.g., reduced subsidies on synthetic fertilizers; subsidies for manure storage and processing as well as fish pond development) and to avoid excess fertilization. LEAP 2018a.

P6. P7. Provide livestock farms with technical assistance and financing options for the piloting of biogas schemes to generate renewable energy. SNV Biogas.</div> </div>
