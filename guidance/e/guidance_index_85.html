Improve feed ration balancing.

Increase the use of resources locally available for livestock feed.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Adequate feed ration balancing already contributes to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities. Feedipedia.

P4. Explore the scope for including more by-products and food waste: availability, practical arrangements for collection and processing, and regulatory framework to avoid public health issues. 

P4. P7. Raise awareness among feed crop producers and provide technical assistance and financing options to produce feed crops sustainably, for instance, in relation to the use of water and pesticides and to tillage practices. FAO 2012b, FAO 2014a.

P4. P7. Source imported feed sustainably, considering the fossil fuel emissions generated for feed production and transport, the use of heavy metals, and other environmental impacts on land and water resources. Include the environmental impacts associated with imported feed in project environmental impact assessments. LEAP 2016b. Promote the piloting of a livestock feed certification and labeling scheme.

P3. Reductions in production cost and income gains resulting from improving animal productivity may result in growing demand and thus in an overall production increase. Assess the potential adverse effects on human diets and natural resources. LEAP 2018a, LEAP 2018b, LEAP 2016c.</div> </div>
