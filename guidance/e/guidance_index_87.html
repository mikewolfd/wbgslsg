Import animals/animal semen with improved genetics for crossbreeding.

Develop artificial insemination.</div> <div class='guidance-area'>P3. Improving animal genetics already contributes to sustainability by improving feed conversion ratios and disease resistance.

P3. Consider the resilience of any exotic breeds to local agroecological conditions, water availability, climate variability, and drought. Ensure that farm buildings and farm equipment respond to these animal requirements in an environmentally safe way (e.g., water use, energy use efficiency). FAO 2010.

P4. Cross-breeding with high-productivity breeds may require more and higher-quality feed, potentially increasing the environmental impacts of feed production. Ensure that any increased demand for higher-quality feed is met sustainably. </div> </div>
