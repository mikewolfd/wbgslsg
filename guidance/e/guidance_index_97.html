-	Progressive and targeted ban of direct discharge of manure and slurry into waterways.
-	Subsidy programs for producers investing in manure storage and processing and for developing nutrient management plans.
-	Capacity development programs on waste management for producers and processors.

-	Rebalance subsidy programs for synthetic fertilizers and manure to make manure recycling comparatively more attractive.
-	Develop regulations and subsidized pricing policies to allow governments and utility companies to purchase renewable energy (e.g., biogas, solar) from agricultural production units.</div> </div>
