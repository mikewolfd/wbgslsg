                    Livestock play a significant role in addressing many of the challenges that low- and middle-income countries
                    face. Livestock production generates income, jobs, economic growth, and exports. Livestock in some regions are
                    culturally significant, central to local diets, and critical to risk management and resilience.

                    Animal-sourced foods are a key source of protein and micronutrients across the globe. They are also sources of
                    resilience through risk management and asset building in harsher, water-scarce environments.

                <p>
                    Livestock often contribute to local agroecological health by consuming co-products and wastes; providing organic
                    manure to maintain soil structure and fertility; and contributing to on-farm biodiversity. At the same time,
                    livestock production can harm the environment, for example, through incentivizing land use change, emitting
                    greenhouse gases (GHG), and generating pollution.

<p>You are designing your project and looking for ways to improve its environmental sustainability. Start by choosing the context
of your project, then select one project objective, and the intervention you are considering. The ISL Tool will then provide tailored guidance for
project design and indicators for the results framework.</p>
