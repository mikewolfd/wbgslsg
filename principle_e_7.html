                    INTRODUCTION
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Livestock play a significant role in addressing many of the challenges that low- and middle-income countries
                    face. Livestock production generates income, jobs, economic growth, and exports. Livestock in some regions are
                    culturally significant, central to local diets, and critical to risk management and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Animal-sourced foods are a key source of protein and micronutrients across the globe. They are also sources of
                    resilience through risk management and asset building in harsher, water-scarce environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Livestock often contribute to local agroecological health by consuming co-products and wastes; providing organic
                    manure to maintain soil structure and fertility; and contributing to on-farm biodiversity. At the same time,
                    livestock production can harm the environment, for example, through incentivizing land use change, emitting
                    greenhouse gases (GHG), and generating pollution.
                </p>
                <h6>

                    POINTS OF CONSIDERATION:
                </h6>
                <p>

                    Sustainable livestock sector investment will undertake stakeholder engagement and preparatory research
                    to consider the development objectives of the proposed project and the role of livestock in achieving
                    those objectives.
                </p>

                <p>

                    As part of the project conceptualization process, stakeholder engagement and preparatory research can be
                    undertaken to explore the synergies and trade-offs of investing in different food sources. Approaching
                    project conceptualization in this manner presents a significant opportunity for livestock investment to
                    go beyond the traditional objective of fulfilling current and projected demand for livestock products.
                </p>

                <p>

                    By considering the full range of locally suitable food sources, investment can respond to demand
                    strategically. This incentivizes growth in specific livestock species where it can be sustainable and
                    consumption of other foods where it is less.

                    <h6>
                        APPROACHES AND TOOLS:
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        A large body of research suggests that reducing the environmental impact per unit of food produced will be a
                        critical strategy for achieving a sustainable food system. This “per unit” approach to quantifying environmental
                        impact can form the basis of an ex-ante analysis of potential environmental impacts and of indicators used in
                        the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework. Variables to measure would include resource use
                        efficiency (the amount of land, pesticide, water, or other resource inputs required to produce each unit of
                        human-edible output) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (emissions per unit of human-edible output produced).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A growing body of research, however, also points out the need to improve the sustainability of the food system
                        from the consumer perspective, for example, by combining dietary changes with practice improvement. Depending on
                        the project context, it may thus be relevant to consider absolute magnitudes of environmental impact as related
                        to consumption levels, such as total land required for the project or total volume of emissions estimated to
                        result from the project.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            ✓ Guiding questions for stakeholder engagement may include:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✓ What is the role of livestock in local food preferences and culture?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✓ What is the role of livestock in the country/province’s development agenda, for instance, for rural
                            livelihoods, job creation, trade, and agricultural sector growth?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✓ What are the nutritional needs of the project area? Does the relevant population meet national dietary
                            recommendations for the consumption of animal-sourced foods?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✓ What is the role of livestock in the country’s capacity to build resilience to climate change?
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            ✓ Do the local natural resource base and climate favor livestock production at present and according to
                            future
                            projections? If so, which species? If not, which other food sources would be suitable?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✓ What are the potential environmental impacts of suitable animal-sourced and plant-based foods?
                        </p>
                    </ul>

                            As the team assesses the comparative advantage of livestock to development goals of the project, it may
                            consider the following elements:

                            ✓ Kilogram (kg) of additional animal products protein and/or milligram (mg) of micronutrients made available
                            to project beneficiaries, and how they contribute to current diets, reduce potential deficits, and/or add to
                            overconsumption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ✓ Livestock-related jobs and income generated among the poor in the project scenario, compared to
                            alternative investment options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ✓ Incremental use of natural resources (water, land, nitrogen, phosphorus) in the project scenario and the
                            related increase on resources, compared to other investment options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ✓ Incremental release of harmful emissions (GHG, pesticides) in the project scenario and the related
                            increase on resources compared to other investment options.

                <h6>TRADE-OFFS</h6>
                <p>
                    Principle 1 offers a framework for broadly considering the role of livestock in the context of a potential
                    development investment. It thus applies to the early stages of project conceptualization before other principles
                    are triggered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Principles 2 through 6 focus on the key production practices and technologies that contribute to improving the
                    environmental performance of livestock supply chains.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Principle 1 applies to all Sustainable Development Goals and how livestock production systems may contribute to
                    those.
